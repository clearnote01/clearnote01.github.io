Okay, this is fairly self-explanatory, I have found myself to have an horrible habit of going to read reviews on the internet - like how others reacted to something I read or watched on Youtube or Reddit, immediately after I have finished that specific media. Sometimes I am just looking for affirmation. GoT jumped shark after season 4, right? right guys? *cricket noises intesifies*, a specific scene was so well acted, or the score so beautiful, I am seeking validation of my opinion. But I think more often it's worse than that, I haven't yet formed my own opinion on something, but I quickly start searching how others reacted and now I am just getting influenced by what I am reading. Huh, this guy is raising a good point, that scene didn't make any sense! But wait, that's not what I really felt while watching, that time it was something I could ignore, but I am now backfilling my enjoyment of the media based on what I read online. Why it bothers me is because I think with this I am robbing myself of actually thinking, knowing all the facts before forming opinion is generally considered a good thing, however I think in case of media - book, tv shows, movies, really what you are given should be enough to form your opinion, and being so lazy that you are taking the "general consensus" without really thinking about it is something I definitely want to change for myself!

Would a person who is more open, be more flexible and hence easily influenceable? Conversely a person with more rigid standing be more resistant on this? I don't know, I think there are things I have strong opinions about, but for somethings I don't have that strong opinions. If I have really invested myself into something, it would naturally follow that I will be more opinionated on that. I think for media, it's not that I have "invest" myself a lot, just giving a moment, and being mindful while experiencing it, I think can give me a richer experience. So yes, no more scrolling down to Youtube comment section after video, no more immediately going to Reddit, or other review sites, before I really have given it a moment to settle in my mind, and formed an opinion about all these things!
