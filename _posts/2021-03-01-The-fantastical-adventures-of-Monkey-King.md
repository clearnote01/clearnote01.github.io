Long ago, the realms of Sky and Land were not as mixed as they are today. Sky was the place of Godly Kings. The Land was of animal tribes. Monkeys were one of the more pacifist land tribes, preferring there abode of Flower & Fruit mountain, and it's not like they had much choice, after all they had none of the brutishness of the Boar or the cunning of the Cat, the animal kingdom was not a kind place for them. However with Flower & Fruit mountain, the monkeys had found a special place, with plenty of fruits growing all year, and the safety of altitude. This is the place which Monkey's would call their home and Monkey King's kingdom. 

Since most of the tales of his greatness come directly from him, there is lack of credible knowledge of his birth and initial years. One thing we know is that his initial years wouldn't have been easy, the monkey tribe used to be nomadic before finding home in Flower & Fruit mountain, the food was uncertain and there was always risks of other animals hunting the poor monkeys. The tribe had grown fairly weak at that point. Monkey King's father was the tribe leader and is believed to be tormented with frequent visions from the Maker himself. Sriracha, the tribe priest says, at times that he would be totally a different person - with hasty determination, and strength that was more humanoid than monkey. It was believed that it was in one of these visions he had drawn a map with a destination to the place which was was going to be there new home, Flower & Fruit mountain. 

Unfortunately his father appears to have passed away shortly after his madness inspired map making. His last days have been said to be uncharacteristically quiet and one day he just didn't wake up after his sleep. The tribe did reach the mythical place following his map though and where the Monkey King was born, his mother dying soon after birth.
