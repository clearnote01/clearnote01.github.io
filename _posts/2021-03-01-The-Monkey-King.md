Long ago, the realms of Sky and Land were not as mixed as they are today. Sky was the place of Godly Kings. The Land was of animal tribes. Monkeys were one of the more pacifist land tribes, preferring there abode of Flower & Fruit mountain, and it's not like they had much choice, after all they had none of the brutishness of the Boar or the cunning of the Cat, the animal kingdom was not a kind place for them. However with Flower & Fruit mountain, the monkeys had found a special place, with plenty of fruits growing all year, and the safety of altitude. This is what the Monkey King was born and where most of his legends came to be.
