Several days I wake up and still be sleep. It's a fasicnating time of the day for me, probably my favorite time. I have to wake up to start my work, in these days WFH work, but still I like to join at a specific time of the day, routine is good. But the morning is a time when I am calm. and I am asleep. I don't tddream at night, not often at least.  Bur rhwaw moeninf dreams are very different. I feel like I get to choose what I want to see, and then I get wings and, I need to have a spark of thought and then my subconcious takes me soemwhere. I am not awake, it's on an edge of sleep and dreams. In this time I don't have to try to fit, I just do , ovbioulsy it's  aworld created by my own whilm. But it feels real, taht space feels like a different world. Now understandably you can say what good is it to dream, when the body is in this real world, the physical world, you will get cold, hungry, you need place to live.Everything is physical and your dreaming isn't going to sustain your life. Well that's true but that I believe is because we have barely begun to understand dreams, much less make use of it. We hear of "life flashing before your eyes" situation, where your mind in mere seconds shows you entire lifetime, I am contesting the validation of this, but there ought to be some truth to it, and during the times of Monring fever I feel like I can almost grasp the time dilation.
